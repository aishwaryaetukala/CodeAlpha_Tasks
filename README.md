## 📌 Task 1: Iris Flower Classification

### Objective:
To build a machine learning model that classifies Iris flowers into three species:
- Iris-setosa
- Iris-versicolor
- Iris-virginica

### Approach:
- Data preprocessing using Pandas
- Train-test split (80/20)
- Logistic Regression model using Scikit-learn
- Model evaluation using:
  - Accuracy Score
  - Confusion Matrix
  - Classification Report

### Result:
The model achieved **100% accuracy** on the test dataset.
